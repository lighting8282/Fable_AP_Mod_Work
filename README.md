# Fable AP Mod Work

Working record of tooling and findings for cataloging **Fable: The Lost Chapters / Fable Anniversary item CDEFs** (definition IDs), in support of an Archipelago (AP) randomizer world. This builds on top of two upstream projects by **Yaranorgoth (lgbarrere)**:

- [`FableAnniversary-Random`](https://github.com/lgbarrere/FableAnniversary-Random) — dinput8 proxy mod loader + `add_item_mod` (spawns an item into the hero's inventory on F1)
- `FableModdingTools` (FA-SYMLINKER) — symlinks FTLC ↔ Fable Anniversary so FTLC tools (Fable Explorer ShadowNet, ChocolateBox) work on Anniversary

## The problem

Building an AP world needs a full table of item IDs (CDEFs) mapped to in-game display names. FESN's `OBJECT` list contains ~2,850 definitions, but:

1. Most are world objects (walls, doors, scenery), not inventory items.
2. Internal symbol names often don't match display names (`OBJECT_SUPER_HEALTH_POTION` = "Elixir of Life"; `OBJECT_BOOK_STORY_04` = "A Hero's Journey II").

The original manual workflow was: look up a CDEF in FESN → paste into `add_item_mod.cpp` line 163 → rebuild → launch → load save → press F1 → check inventory / observe crash → record → repeat. Minutes per single ID.

## What was built

### 1. CDEF extraction (`tools/parse_fesn_screenshot_dump.py`, `data/cdefs.txt`)

FESN has no bulk export and its tree doesn't support copy. The full `OBJECT` tree was captured via screenshots, transcribed, and parsed with a regex (`ID - SYMBOL_NAME`) into `data/cdefs.txt` — **2,852 unique CDEFs** with symbol names. Also exported as `data/OBJECT_tree_full_list.tsv`.

Note: FESN's tree only populated after **File → Open** on `data/CompiledDefs/game.bin` inside the FTLC install; the `OBJECT_FAMILLY` section is groupings of OBJECT CDEFs, not additional item definitions, and was skipped.

### 2. Name auto-matcher (`tools/match_cdefs_to_items.py`, `data/matched_items.tsv`)

Normalizes symbol names (strip `OBJECT_` prefix, `_01` variant suffixes, punctuation) and matches them against the AP item sheet (`data/Fable lists for AP - Items.tsv`). **46 items auto-matched** on the first pass (weapons, potions, food, augmentations, some quest items). Books/clothing/tattoos/styles don't match by name and need in-game testing.

### 3. Outer-loop batch tester (`tools/batch_test_cdefs.py`) — superseded

Automates the original loop: patches `add_item_mod.cpp`, runs `deploy.bat`, waits for the user to load a save and press F1, then reads `mods/add_item_mod/add_item_mod.log` for `CreateFableItem`/`AddItemToInventory` results and detects crashes via process polling. Results append to CSV, crash-safe.

Still ~1 build+boot cycle per ID (~1–2 min each). Kept for reference; superseded by the in-game batch mod.

Caveat discovered: synthetic `keybd_event` F1 never reaches the game because it runs elevated (UIPI blocks lower-privilege synthetic input), so the script asks the user to press F1 themselves.

### 4. In-game batch tester (`mods/batch_test_mod/`) — the current workhorse

New mod DLL loaded by the dinput8 proxy. Per session:

1. Reads `batch_cdefs.txt` (one CDEF per line, placed next to the DLL in `<FTLC>/mods/batch_test_mod/`).
2. Waits until the hero inventory pointer resolves (= save loaded), settles 5 s.
3. Tests each untested CDEF ~1.5 s apart **on the game's main thread** (marshalled via window-message subclassing — engine TLS requirement), writing to `batch_results.csv`:
   - `ADDED_OK` — AddItemToInventory returned 1 (item is in inventory)
   - `REJECTED` — returned 0
   - `CREATE_FAILED` — CThing spawn failed
   - `CRASHED` — a `TESTING` marker written before each attempt is rewritten to this on next boot if it was never resolved
4. Skips already-tested CDEFs on relaunch — **a crash costs one relaunch + save load, then testing resumes automatically.**

No recompiles, no keypresses. 28 IDs tested in ~1 minute of game time in the first session.

**Crash fix (important):** the first version polled `GetHeroInventory()` from a worker thread, which races save-load teardown and crashes the game intermittently. The wait loop now marshals the check to the main thread via `SendMessageTimeout` (`WM_CHECK_INVENTORY`).

Items are added with `silent=true`. This matters: books tested via the old F1 path (`silent=false`) returned **REJECTED** and sometimes crashed; the same books via the silent path are **ADDED_OK** and appear in inventory. The pickup sound/UI path appears to be what fails, not the item add.

### 5. Quality-of-life changes to the upstream mod loader (`modified-files/`)

These are copies of the modified upstream files (originals belong to lgbarrere's repo):

- **`dinput8.sln`** — hand-written classic `.sln`; the repo ships `dinput8.slnx`, which requires VS 17.10+ (MSB4068 on older MSBuild). VS 2026 also builds the `.slnx` fine.
- **`deploy.bat`** — solution path switched to `.sln`; `DEFAULT_DIR_FTLC_STEAM` pointed at the actual install (`A:\SteamLibrary\...`).
- **`windowed_hook.cpp`** — added `MakeBorderless()`: strips title bar/border (WS_POPUP) after CreateDevice and re-applies on device Reset.
- **`dllmain.cpp`** — hooks `IDirectInput8::CreateDevice` → `SetCooperativeLevel` so the **mouse** is exclusive+foreground (single accurate cursor in-game, auto-released on alt-tab) while the **keyboard** is non-exclusive+foreground (Print Screen / Win keys work). Device instances created with `GUID_SysMouse` are tracked because all DirectInput device instances share one vtable.
  - First attempt (non-exclusive mouse) caused a double-cursor desync: game cursor driven by relative deltas + free OS cursor receiving the actual clicks.
  - Even so, the game minimizes on focus loss, which breaks screenshot tools — workaround: a delayed PowerShell `CopyFromScreen` capture fired from another terminal while the game keeps focus.

## Findings so far

| Category | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Potions (4292–4299) | 4294 confirmed ADDED_OK | "Elixir of Life"; the guide's known-good test ID |
| Gold (4644–4660) | **CRASHES** (10/10 tested) | Gold is a player counter, not an inventory CThing. `AddItemToInventory` is the wrong mechanism — an AP implementation needs a direct gold-stat function |
| Trophies (4495–4510) | 16/16 ADDED_OK | Display names confirmed by screenshot (below) |
| Books (4539–4550) | 12/12 ADDED_OK (silent add) | REJECTED/crashy via non-silent F1 path |
| Food (4274–4289) | tested via old script | see session CSVs |

### Confirmed CDEF → display name mappings

## Sheet sync

We work in a **personal copy** of the shared Google Sheet ("Copy of Fable lists for AP"), not the shared one directly, to avoid live-editing something other testers depend on. `data/Fable lists for AP - Items.tsv` mirrors that copy's "Items" tab exactly.

Sync process (no reliable automated export was found — Google blocks unauthenticated fetches on private sheets, and the in-browser download didn't land in an accessible folder in this environment):

1. In the sheet: **File → Download → Tab Separated Values (.tsv)**.
2. Move/rename the downloaded file into this repo's `data/` folder as `Fable lists for AP - Items.tsv` (overwriting the old copy).
3. Commit and push.

Do this after any batch of edits to the sheet (ours or manual). The reverse direction — new CDEFs confirmed via `batch_test_mod` — get entered into the sheet directly (via browser automation or by hand) before running this export, so the TSV always reflects the sheet's current state.

Note: the sheet's own category assignments don't always match assumptions made earlier in this file — e.g. "Bandit Seal" exists as **two separate rows**, one under Quest (no CDEF) and one under Trophy (CDEF 4495, confirmed). Trust the TSV/sheet over category guesses in the tables above.

## Current workflow (per session)

1. Put target CDEFs (one per line) in `<FTLC>/mods/batch_test_mod/batch_cdefs.txt`. To re-test IDs, archive/delete `batch_results.csv` first.
2. `deploy.bat` (only needed if mod source changed — otherwise just launch `Fable.exe`).
3. Load a save. The mod does the rest; watch `batch_results.csv`.
4. If the game crashes: relaunch `Fable.exe`, reload the save — resumes automatically past the crasher.
5. Screenshot the inventory (items appear in ID order) to map display names; on this machine the game minimizes on focus loss, so use a delayed background capture.
6. Feed confirmed mappings back into the AP items sheet.

## Environment notes / gotchas

- FTLC at `A:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fable The Lost Chapters`; FESN config (`FableModdingTools/FA-SYMLINKER/tools/FableExplorer/config.xml`) must point `InstallDirectory` there or its tree stays empty.
- FESN shows data only after File → Open on `data/CompiledDefs/game.bin`.
- The symlinker's option 4 junctions only `Levels/FinalAlbion` (for running the modded game) — it is unrelated to FESN's data loading.
- `deploy.bat` runs elevated; synthetic keyboard input from non-elevated processes won't reach the game (UIPI).
- Windows Store Python 3.13 was used; heredoc/inline `python -c` with multi-line code is unreliable from Git Bash — script files are more dependable.

## Upstream update (2026-07-04): fable1_mods.zip

Yaranorgoth published a prebuilt `fable1_mods.zip` (pinned in the Archipelago Discord `#fable-anniversary` channel) plus `GuideToFindItemCDEFs.txt` recruiting manual testers. Changes on his side:

- `add_item_mod` now reads the CDEF from `mods/add_item_mod/add_item_id.txt` at F1-press — no recompile per ID (solves the same problem as our superseded outer-loop script).
- The windowed hook moved into a separate `mods/windowed_mod/windowed_mod.dll` so it can be deleted independently.
- Results are to be recorded in the shared Google Sheet ("Item" tab). We instead work in a personal copy of that sheet (see "Sheet sync" below) and haven't yet merged findings back into the shared one.

His intended workflow is still one ID at a time by hand (edit txt → F1 → eyeball inventory → update sheet). `batch_test_mod` remains a generation ahead: whole lists per session, no keypresses, silent adds, crash-resume, machine-readable CSV.

**Do not install his zip over a source-built setup** — his `dinput8.dll` replaces ours and drops the borderless + mouse/keyboard cooperative-level fixes (his `windowed_mod` is windowed-only). Building from our modified source provides everything the zip does and more. Untested: whether our `batch_test_mod` finds `g_AddingItemFromMod` in his rebuilt `add_item_mod.dll` (we resolve it at runtime to keep `cancel_vanilla_add_item_mod` from cancelling our adds); irrelevant while building everything from source.

## Next steps

- [ ] Test remaining trophies 4511–4527 (resolves the White Balverine Head / Map To Lost Bay guesses)
- [ ] Test books 4551–4554 (`BOOK_STORY_13–16`) and 4555–4577 (`BOOK_GUILD_*` — symbols suggest they cover most remaining sheet books)
- [ ] Clothing (`OBJECT_HERO_*` 3404–3519) — large range, sheet names won't match symbols; screenshot mapping needed
- [ ] Tattoo/haircut/beard cards (4326–4427)
- [ ] Quest items, gifts, weapons not yet auto-matched
- [ ] Gold: find the direct "give gold" function (AddItemToInventory crashes)
- [ ] Verify TLC CDEFs carry over to Fable Anniversary via the symlink workflow
- [ ] Share findings/tooling with lgbarrere (batch_test_mod restructures his add-item flow; built as a separate mod so his originals are untouched)
- [ ] Decide whether/how to merge our personal sheet copy's confirmed CDEFs back into the shared Google Sheet ("Item" tab)
